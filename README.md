# to-do-list-app-javafx

This is for the Software Development Lab-II assignment. I made for CSE 2100 course. Surprisingly enough, JavaFX works well specifically NetBeans 8.2. I guess it also works with IntelliJ IDEA. But I haven't tried yet. But updated version of Apache Netbeans doesn't work!!

Development uses:
#Netbeans 8.2
#Java: jdk1.8.0_202
#JavaFX
